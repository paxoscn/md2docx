# Rust Code with Comments

Here's some Rust code with comments:

```rust
// This is a comment at the start
fn main() {
    let x = 42; // inline comment
    println!("Hello, world!");
    
    // Another comment
    if x > 0 {
        println!("Positive"); // end of line comment
    }
}
```

The comments should be rendered in italic, and keywords should be bold.
