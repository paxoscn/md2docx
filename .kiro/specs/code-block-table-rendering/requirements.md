# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the code block rendering functionality in the Markdown to DOCX converter by implementing table-based rendering for code blocks. Instead of rendering code blocks as simple paragraphs with monospace font, code blocks will be rendered as single-row, single-column tables. Additionally, the configuration will be updated to use `border_width` instead of the current `border` boolean property for more granular border control.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user converting Markdown documents to DOCX, I want code blocks to be rendered as tables so that they have better visual separation and formatting consistency with other document elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a code block is encountered in the Markdown document THEN the system SHALL render it as a single-row, single-column table
2. WHEN the code block contains multiple lines THEN the system SHALL preserve all line breaks within the table cell
3. WHEN the code block is empty THEN the system SHALL render an empty table with appropriate minimum height
4. WHEN the code block contains special characters or formatting THEN the system SHALL preserve the original text content without modification

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user configuring the document conversion, I want to control the border width of code block tables so that I can customize the visual appearance to match my document style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the configuration uses `border_width` property THEN the system SHALL apply the specified border width to the code block table
2. WHEN `border_width` is set to 0 THEN the system SHALL render the table without visible borders
3. WHEN `border_width` is greater than 0 THEN the system SHALL render the table with borders of the specified width
4. WHEN the configuration contains the old `border` boolean property THEN the system SHALL continue to work for backward compatibility

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the configuration model to be updated to use `border_width` instead of `border` so that the API is more consistent and flexible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `CodeBlockStyle` struct is defined THEN it SHALL use `border_width: f32` instead of `border: bool`
2. WHEN validating the configuration THEN the system SHALL ensure `border_width` is non-negative
3. WHEN serializing/deserializing configuration THEN the system SHALL handle both old and new property names for backward compatibility
4. WHEN the default configuration is created THEN it SHALL use a reasonable default value for `border_width`

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with existing configuration files, I want my current settings to continue working so that I don't need to manually update all my configuration files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading a configuration file with the old `border: true` property THEN the system SHALL convert it to `border_width: 1.0`
2. WHEN loading a configuration file with the old `border: false` property THEN the system SHALL convert it to `border_width: 0.0`
3. WHEN loading a configuration file with the new `border_width` property THEN the system SHALL use the specified value directly
4. WHEN both old and new properties are present THEN the system SHALL prioritize the new `border_width` property

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user converting documents, I want the table-rendered code blocks to maintain the same font and styling options as before so that the visual appearance remains consistent with my configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering code blocks as tables THEN the system SHALL apply the configured font family, size, bold, and italic settings
2. WHEN a background color is configured THEN the system SHALL apply it to the table cell
3. WHEN line spacing is configured THEN the system SHALL apply it within the table cell
4. WHEN preserve_line_breaks is enabled THEN the system SHALL maintain line breaks within the table cell content
